# Welcome to Z5omes

Z5omes is a CAD tool designed to assist in the creation of polyhedral frames and structures.

Whether you're a carpenter, maker, designer, or geometry enthusiast, Z5omes helps you explore and build a specific
polyhedral
shape — a kind of [zonohedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonohedron) known as
the [Zome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zome_(architecture)) — with
precision and ease.

Originally developed with timber framing in mind,
Z5omes provides a new software for crafting unique architectural
and artistic projects based on polyhedral geometry.

It's a creative and technical companion for anyone working at the intersection of craftsmanship and design.

To make your own Zome, please check the online app :

## Let's talk a little bit about Zomes.

#### 🔷 Is a Zome a Zonohedron?

Yes, absolutely! 💡

#### 🔍 Quick Definition:

The word <b>"Zome"</b> comes from combining <b>"Zonohedron"</b> and <b>"Dome"</b>. It refers to a geometric and
architectural structure built
using the principles of Zonohedra, often involving symmetry, spirals, and sacred geometry patterns like rhombuses and
pentagons.

#### ✅ Characteristics of a Zome:

* It's a special type of zonohedron, often built with rhombic (diamond-shaped) faces.
* The structure can twist or spiral, with each level rotated slightly from the one below.
* It’s both geometric and aesthetic, with uses in:

    * Alternative architecture (eco-buildings, organic design),
    * Meditation or wellness spaces,
    * Designs inspired by sacred geometry.

#### 🧠 Summary:

* ✅ All Zomes are zonohedra.
* 🚫 But not all zonohedra are Zomes.

# About the Project

This project was designed to be free and will never be charged for.
That said, if you'd like to support the journey, you’re welcome
to [buy me a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/z5omes) ☕.

🙏 I would first like to thank [Tim Hutton](https://github.com/timhutton/) from whom I took inspiration
for the trigonometry calculations ◁ and who allowed me to launch this project. 🚀

While I wasn't a big fan originally and need to check what he writes,
🤖 ChatGPT has helped me a lot with understanding vector calculations and the intersection of planes.

Sylvain Huet from [La tanière à mémé](https://www.domegeodesique-yourte.com/) called me one day
to create a 3D model with the "GoodKarma" method.
<br>Thanks to his knowledge, we were able to improve the app.

You can now to print the dimensions of the timbers, print origami stuffs, etc...

I hope this app will help zome lovers to build their dream cabin/house. 🏠

Have fun and don't hesitate to share the creation of your Zome.<br>
And if you have any requests/questions, see any bugs, ✍ feel free to write
an [issue](https://github.com/florianwns/z5omes/issues/new) inside GitHub.

🌟

## 🌎 Translations

I prefered use an homemade version of i18n, to make the app faster and lighter.

So if you want add a new language to Z5omes,
you can copy the [i18n/en.js](i18n/en.js) file and modify the new file.

Please, fork the project, commit your changes and pull a new request. 🙏

## ▲ 3D Modeling

<b>Z5omes</b> allows you to create 3D models for free.
You can now create your models with 'GoodKarma', 'Beleved' or 'Xpansion' assembly method.

You can export your Zome to different 3D object formats:

> * <b>GLTF</b> : Mesh and texture
> * <b>OBJ</b> : Mesh and texture (MTL file)
> * <b>STL</b> : Mesh only (mm unit, inverted YZ)
> * <b>PLY</b> : Mesh only

If you need a different format, you can import the OBJ file
in [FreeCad](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php), [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/#download)
or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/),
then export the mesh in the format of your choice.
<br>
<br>I got pretty good results with these free softwares.

> 👁 Take a look at the '[meshes](meshes)' folder if you want to see some examples.

## 🙏 Thanks To :

This project would never have been possible without the valuable support of a few people.
So, I would like to say a big thank you 🙏

> * [Tim Hutton](https://github.com/timhutton/) whose github project inspired me for trigonometry and zome envelop
    calculation.
> * [Dims Zomes](http://www.rusticdomes.com/software.html) who allowed me to check my data.
> * [La tanière à mémé](https://www.domegeodesique-yourte.com/) for sharing knowledge particularly on the GoodKarma
    understanding.
> * Every donors and members of the 'Zomes' community

## ⚡ Powered by :

Most of the calculations were written in the code.
However, for visualization as well as for the functional side within javascript,
I relied on several libraries.

> * [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) : The awesome JS toolbox. 🧰
> * [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) : For 3D vizualisation.
> * [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) : A very good minimal framework for composing behavior directly in HTML.
> * [Flag-Icons](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons) : For flag languages
