# Z5omes | A Zome Maker

<b>Z5omes</b> allows you to create 3D models for free.
You can now create your models in GoodKarma and Semicone (Axis of symmetry)
and export them in STL (sketchup import: mm unit, inverted YZ), OBJ or other formats.

To make your own Zome, check the app [here](https://florianwns.github.io/z5omes/).

## The Project

This project was designed to be free and will never be charged for. 
However, you have the right to [offer me a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/z5omes) ☕ if you want to help me in my approach.

🙏 I would first like to thank [Tim Hutton](https://github.com/timhutton/) from whom I took inspiration 
for the trigonometry calculations ◁ and who allowed me to launch this project. 🚀

While I wasn't a big fan originally and need to check what he writes, 
🤖 ChatGPT has helped me a lot with understanding vector calculations and the intersection of planes.

Sylvain Huet from [La tanière à mémé](https://www.domegeodesique-yourte.com/) called me one day 
to create a 3D module in GoodKarma. Thanks to his knowledge, we were able to develop the algorithm and today here is this new version of the application.

Soon other new modules will arrive such as being able 
to print the dimensions of the timbers.

I hope this app will help zome lovers to build their dream cabin/house. 🏠



Have fun and don't hesitate to share the creation of your Zome.

## Powered by : 

Most of the calculations were written in the code.
However, for visualization as well as for the functional side within javascript, 
I relied on several libraries.

> * [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) : The awesome JS toolbox. 🧰
> * [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) : For 3D vizualisation.
> * [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) : A very good minimal framework for composing behavior directly in HTML.


## Thanks To :

This project would never have been possible without the valuable support of a few people. 
So, I would like to say a big thank you 🙏

> * [Tim Hutton](https://github.com/timhutton/) whose github project inspired me for trigonometry and zome envelop calculation.
> * [Dims Zomes](http://www.rusticdomes.com/software.html) who allowed me to check my data.
> * [La tanière à mémé](https://www.domegeodesique-yourte.com/) for sharing knowledge particularly on the GoodKarma understanding.
